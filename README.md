# Astro Starter Kit: Basics

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The important files and folders to take note of are as follows:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro - Contains the different React components embedded within it
â””â”€â”€ package.json - Description of the project with its associated higher level yarn dependencies
â””â”€â”€ astro.config.mjs - Configuration for Astro
â””â”€â”€ renovate.json - Schema for Renovate Bot (creates automated pull requests to update the yarn ependencies)

â””â”€â”€ yarn.lock - Dependency tree for Yarn
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
